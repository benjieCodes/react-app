# Reach App "CATCH OF THE DAY"

### I've created an application to create a store, login using your social handle, and create an inventory to order amazing seafood!


- used JSX syntax with React framework to build components
- used firebase for backend support
- implemented auth tokens for Facebook, Github, and Twitter accounts

## How to use
- git clone my project!
- on terminal run script 'npm start'
- ENJOY!
